# PureNix Organization Members

This document lays out guidelines for members of the [`purenix-org`](https://github.com/purenix-org) GitHub Organization.
If you get added to `purenix-org`, take a look at this document.

Here are the main guidelines:

-   If you've gotten the commit bit in `purenix-org`, we fully trust you to use it to improve the PureNix ecosystem.
    You don't necessarily need to get permission on making any big changes, including things like creating new repositories, or re-organizing existing libraries.
    (Of course, creating an issue or opening a proof-of-concept PR to discuss things beforehand is always welcome!)

-   We generally want changes to come in through PRs, not to be committed directly to the master branch.
    If you haven't gotten any feedback to your PR in a week or so, feel free to re-ping the other maintainers, or just merge the PR in yourself.

-   We appreciate documentation, especially comments in the code, or markdown files in the repo.
    If neither of those make sense, then an explanation in an issue or PR is also helpful.

-   We value moving things forward over excessive bike-shedding.
    Changes that turn out to be bad can always be rolled back.
    Since PureNix is a new ecosystem, it has a much higher risk of never attracting maintainers and users, rather than failing for bad decisions made by the maintainers.

-   Please be proactive in giving out the commit bit to people who seem interested in improving the PureNix ecosystem.

If PureNix ever becomes widely successful, we may have to make these guidelines a tad more conservative.
